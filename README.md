# SFML-Snake
This version of snake game is the second part of my journey to learning C++. It was based off the Google search engine snake, however the project's evolution meant that it was both closer and further away from the actual google snake at different points in development. This being my second project in the world of C++, it introduce a lot of concepts such as classes, multi file projects, CMake, SFML and probably a whole lot more.

## Build
To build, a version of CMake above v4.0.0 is needed and a version of SFML above v3.0.0. Once these requirements are set, make sure that CMake can find SFML, create a build directory and build as usual.
